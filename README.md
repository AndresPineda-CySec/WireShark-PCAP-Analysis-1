<h1>WireShark PCAP Analysis 1</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this analysis, I examined network traffic within the IP LAN segment 10.1.17.0/24, which has a range of 10.1.17.0 - 10.1.17.255. I also know the LAN gateway is 10.1.17.0 and the LAN broadcast address is 10.1.17.255. The scenario involves an employee who downloaded a suspicious file from a supposed "google authenicator" website and is suspected of communicating with a Command and Control (C2) server. My goal was to identify any unusual traffic patterns or connections to external IPs that could indicate data exfiltration or C2 communication. <br />

Knowing that there is a compromised host in the LAN segment 10.1.17.0/24 communicating with a C2 server, I can view unusual amounts of traffic by selecting "Statistics" and then selecting "Conversations." This will open the Conversations window, allowing me to view the packets sent from IP A to IP B. In the Conversations Window, I select the IPv4 tab and sort the lines by the most packets being sent. Right away, the first two lines jump off the screen due to the high amounts of packets being sent from one another. Before labeling this as malicious, I have to take a deeper dive; but seeing that IP A is sending out 822 KB of data while both IP B's are sending 17 MB of data, I can almost already determine that the IP 10.1.17.215 is the compromised host, and IP addresses 45.125.66.32 and 5.252.153.241 are being used for c2 traffic.<br />
<br />
<br />
If my assumptions are correct, I will also focus on the IP address 45.125.66.252 because it comes from the same network as the aforementioned IP 45.125.66.32.
The next step of my investigation will be to check each external IP address that has sent over one thousand packets. For now, I will start with the three IP addresses I am suspicious of, starting with 45.125.66.32<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://github.com/AndresPineda-CySec/WireShark-PCAP-Analysis-1/blob/main/images/2025-03-13_10-33.png?raw=true" height="70%" width="70%"/> <br />
I apply the filter "ip.addr == 45.125.66.32" to view the traffic from or to the suspicious IP address. Once applied, it reveals a back-and-forth conversation with the IP address, which I think is the infected host.<br />
<br />
<br />

To further analyze the conversation I right click the first frame to view the "TCP Stream." Just a couple lines down I see "Self-signed certificate," which in many cases allows C2 servers to encrypt their traffic.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://github.com/AndresPineda-CySec/WireShark-PCAP-Analysis-1/blob/main/images/2025-03-13_10-54.png?raw=true" height="100%" width="100%"/> <br />
Specifying a string filter to show the results of the packets with "encrypted" in the "Info" column, I gather further evidence that this external IP address uses a self-signed Certificate to encrypt data. For now, I'm going to skip over IP 5.252.153.214, and I'm going to check the other IP from the same network to continue my investigation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://github.com/AndresPineda-CySec/WireShark-PCAP-Analysis-1/blob/main/images/2025-03-13_11-05.png?raw=true" height="100%" width="100%"/> <br />
Once again, I applied the same filter as before but updated the IP to "45.125.66.252." Once I have all traffic involving the suspicious IP address, I right-click on the first frame and open the "TCP Stream" window. In the new window, I again see a self-signed Certificate, but this time, there is also a "JDOWNGRD" above the self-signed certificate. This is extremely dangerous because it resembles a downgrade attack.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, it's time to check the IP address 5.252.153.241. I start by applying the filter "ip.addr == 5.252.153.241" to see traffic involving only 5.252.153.241. Once again I see the victim IP, 10.1.17.215, being communicated with.<br />
<br />
<br />

<img src="https://github.com/AndresPineda-CySec/WireShark-PCAP-Analysis-1/blob/main/images/mal2.png?raw=true" width="100%"/> <br />  
I then right-click an HTTP frame, select "follow," then select "HTTP Stream." This provides the first hard evidence of a C2 server and data exfiltration, proving that 10.1.17.215 is the infected host. Inside the HTTP Stream I found an Indicator of compromise (IOC); a PowerShell script that facilitates data exfiltration by sending logs to a remote server. The script creates a directory named "jsLeow" and stores a malicious file called "skqllz.ps1" inside it. It constructs an upload URL by appending stolen data to a predefined variable and uses the "System.Net.WebClient" object to exfiltrate the information via HTTP requests. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands, encoded payloads, and suspicious directory creation strongly indicates malicious activity designed to evade detection while maintaining persistence on the compromised system.<br />

<h3 align="center">Checking other IP Addresses with unusually high traffic:</h3>
<p align="center">
The next IPs I need to check are 82.221.136.26, 23.55.125.176, and 10.1.17.2.
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://github.com/AndresPineda-CySec/WireShark-PCAP-Analysis-1/blob/main/images/2025-03-14_08-41.png?raw=true" height="100%" width="100%"/> <br />
The first IP address Iâ€™ll examine from the three is 82.221.136.26. Immediately, I notice an associated domain named "authenticatoor.org". Several red flags stand out since this domain should logically belong to Google. First, the misspelling of the word "authenticator" as "authenticatoor" is highly suspicious. Second, the use of the ".org" top-level domain further raises concerns, as Google typically adheres to a consistent domain pattern, such as "---.google.com." These inconsistencies strongly suggest that the domain is not legitimate and likely malicious. The use of encryption, in this case, is also very suspicious.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://github.com/AndresPineda-CySec/WireShark-PCAP-Analysis-1/blob/main/images/whois.png?raw=true" height="100%" width="100%"/> <br />
To further prove the invalidity of the domain, I used the command "whois" in my Linux terminal to view key information about the IP, further proving this IP does not belong to Google.<br />
<br />
<br /> 
While the IP is malicious, it only spoofs the user into downloading a malicious file and is not one of the C2 server IP addresses.<br />
<br />
<br />
The IP address 23.55.125.176 does not seem malicious but may have been compromised due to its communication with the infected host. the conversation between 10.1.17.215 and 23.55.125.176 seems to be an attempt to exfiltrate data from an Azure.microsoft server.<br />
The next IP I will review is 10.1.17.2, a local host on the network.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://github.com/AndresPineda-CySec/WireShark-PCAP-Analysis-1/blob/main/images/2025-03-14_09-55.png?raw=true" height="100%" width="100%"/> <br />
Once filtered to only show traffic involving the IP address 10.1.17.2, I found that 10.1.17.215 has been communicating with this host. It appears the infected host has been requesting information about the database, specifically querying for sensitive data. The communication includes multiple requests to access database records, which could indicate an attempt to exfiltrate or manipulate data. The nature of these requests, coupled with the unusual behavior observed from the originating host, suggests that it may be compromised or involved in malicious activity.<br />
<br />
<br />
After thoroughly reviewing the remaining IP addresses the infected host communicated with, I determined that all interactions focused on retrieving information. None of the other IP addresses exhibited any signs of malicious activity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">The Infected Host:</h3>

<img src="https://github.com/AndresPineda-CySec/WireShark-PCAP-Analysis-1/blob/main/images/hostInfo.png?raw=true" height="100%" width="100%"/> <br />
In order to enumerate the infected host, I apply the filter "ip.src == 10.1.17.215 && kerberos" to only view traffic where the infected host is the source address and is running any Kerberos related protocol. I then look for a request packet in order to get information on the host. I selected frame 250 to examine the packet details and learn that the Infected host's name is "DESKTOP-L8C5GSJ," and the MAC address is "00:d0:b7:26:4a:74." <br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://github.com/AndresPineda-CySec/WireShark-PCAP-Analysis-1/blob/main/images/hostName.png?raw=true" height="100%" width="100%"/> <br />
I then opened the TCP Stream for frame 250 and learned the user's Windows account user name is "shutchenson."<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Conclusion:</h3>
<p align="center">
Through my investigation, I discovered the Infected host whose IP is 10.1.17.215, MAC address is 00:d0:b7:26:4a:74, the hostname is DESKTOP-L8C5GSJ, and Windows account user name is shutchenson. I also found the three IP addresses acting as C2 servers: 45.125.66.32, 45.125.66.252, and 5.252.153.241. I found the IP of a fake Google authenticator website and the domain name, which were 82.221.136.26 and authenticatoor.org. I also determined that the IP was only used for downloading the malicious file and not for any exfiltration. I also examined other IP addresses that were communicating with the infected host to see if any other data was leaked, which there wasn't any.<br />
My recommendation for this organization would be to immediately isolate both internal machines, 10.1.17.215 and 10.1.17.2, from the rest of the network. Preserve any evidence by following the order of volatility. I also recommend Employee training.<br />
