<h1>WireShark PCAP Analysis 1</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this analysis, I examined network traffic within the IP LAN segment 10.1.17.0/24, which has a range of 10.1.17.0 - 10.1.17.255. I also know the LAN gateway is 10.1.17.0 and the LAN broadcast address is 10.1.17.255. The scenario involves an employee who downloaded a suspicious file and is suspected of communicating with a Command and Control (C2) server. My goal was to identify any unusual traffic patterns or connections to external IPs that could indicate data exfiltration or C2 communication. <br />
